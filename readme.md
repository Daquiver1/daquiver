<h1 align="center">Hey üëãüèæ<br>
My name is Abrokwa. Christian Abrokwa. Nice to meet you.</h1>

Here's what I do:
  
- I write articles on topics that I find interesting. You can check them out on [Medium](https://daquiver.medium.com)
  
- I have co-developed **UnLost**, a lost and found application, in collaboration with two friends. We are currently focused on enhancing its features with the aim of rolling out **Version 2**. The application is accessible on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unlostitem.unlost&pcampaignid=web_share) and [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/gh/app/unlost/id6449148342)

- I love to talk about backend architecture, and algorithms all dabbled with a bit of philosophy. It's like mixing Plato with Python or Socrates with SQL. 
  
- I occasionally share my thoughts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/daquiver1).

- Basketball, Surfing, and git commits that's me in a nutshell.
